                titleEn: "You in Every Name",
                context: `This poem is a profound and defiant interrogation of divine omnipresence. The speaker systematically lists various aspects of existence–both mundane and profound, positive and negative—and asserts God's presence within them. Each stanza culminates in a rhetorical question that challenges this omnipresence, asking why the speaker himself, or a specific human attribute, is not also divine or the ultimate manifestation. The final lines, directly addressing "Adil" (The Just/Arbiter), escalate this into a direct confrontation, questioning why the divine is in "every name" but not in the very concept of justice or the one who embodies it, implying a deep philosophical despair and a Man vs. Maker conflict.`,

                context: `This poem is a profound inquiry into the origins of various phenomena—from natural occurrences to human emotions and societal constructs. The recurring refrain, "If this fact were known, we would step beyond the Self," highlights a deep existential yearning to transcend the limitations of individual perception and self-awareness. The speaker seeks an understanding that lies beyond the confines of the Wretched Self, implying that true knowledge requires a departure from one's own subjective experience. The "Mirror" here represents a trap of self-perception, and the poem conveys a sense of intellectual weight and philosophical despair in the face of unanswerable questions.`,

                context: `This poem employs a series of negations to assert a detachment from common human fears, desires, and interpretations of reality. The speaker distances himself from notions of destiny, sorrow, and even conventional morality, suggesting a unique, almost defiant, philosophical stance. The "Mirror" is presented as a potentially deceptive or flawed instrument of truth. The repeated denial of agency or identification with universal human conditions ("not us") contributes to a tone of intellectual weight and a subtle critique of societal norms, hinting at a refusal to accept prescribed suffering or meaning.`,

The speaker expresses a profound exhaustion with the cycle of grief and the futility of trying to mend what is broken. The questions posed about solitude, memory, and the heart's persistent longing reflect a deep philosophical despair. The repeated "do not demand today" signifies a boundary, a weary resignation, and a refusal to engage in further self-torment or external expectation.`,

The speaker accepts the beloved's fluctuating actions and the world's denial, while defining his own role as one of enduring acceptance, protection, and reconciliation. The poem's intellectual weight lies in its structural precision, presenting a balanced yet ultimately paradoxical acceptance of both joy and sorrow. The final lines, where the beloved's denials and even sacrifices are deemed the speaker's "good fortune" or "victorious destiny," suggest a profound, almost masochistic, philosophical despair, where suffering is integrated into the fabric of devotion.`,

Nothing was gained except for torment.

                context: `Hoping for the hand of the beloved, night and day, If they do not care in this way, what can I do?

Carrying baseless accusations upon my head as I walk, If I do not live for the touch of the beloved, what life is there to speak of?

She is a flower of the garden city, infinitely kind; I accept she is flower-bodied, I know she is the scent of the rose, So why should I object to the flower's thorn?

With this thought, the story of the caravan of moths returns to memory: Lost in the search for light, all their abodes became like graves; They never returned, nor were their nests ever inhabited again.

Just like wounds inflicted by thorns, just like moths that never returned, Somewhere on the path of life, I met such a companion.

No one is without thorns, nor can anyone truly take life through the burning of love, We just kept longing for the touch of the beloved like this.

Whenever the moments of touch arrived—whenever they came— We continued to understand the Beloved as both the flower's thorn and the volcano.`,

Yun na parwaah kare toh hum kya kare?

Be-qusoor ilzaamat liye sar par chale
Lams-e-yaar ko na jeeyeen toh kya jeeyeen kahe?

Woh sheher-e-gulistan ka ek gul be-had meharbaan
Woh gul-badan hain maana woh nighat-e-gul jaana,
toh khaar-e-gul se kyun aitraaz kare?

Issi soch yaad aaye karvaan-e-paravaano ki daastan
Talaash-e-noor mein gumm huye basere saare lahad ke maanid
Woh phir na laute na huye basere abaad kabhi

Yunhi zakhm jo khaar se lage jo parwaane na laute
Raah-e-zeest mein hum-raah kahi mile

Na koi be-khaar na hi soz-e-ulfat se jaan le sake
Yunhi hi hasrat-e-lams-e-yaar karte rahe

Lamhaat-e-lams aaye kahi jab bhi aaye—
Yaar ko khaar-e-gul o aatish-fishan samajhte rahe`,
